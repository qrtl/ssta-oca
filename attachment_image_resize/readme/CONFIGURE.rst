#. Go to General Settings > Attachment Resize and enter the models you want to resize attachment images for in the 'Attachment Image Resize Models'.
#. In the same section, enter the maximum resolution you want to use for resizing attachment images in the 'Attachment Image Max Resolution'.

Note: If you want to resize the existing attachment images for your resize models, run the 'Resize Attachment Image'
scheduled action. Each run will resize only 1,000 records to prevent prolonged processing times.
You will need to run the action multiple times until all your records are resized.
